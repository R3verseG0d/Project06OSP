Unfortunately Github doesn't like when I try to commit large files. The Total size of the source comes out to around 14.8 GB. 
As a result I will be uploading it to mega in a folder called src. I will upload the folder and not archive it, so feel free to browse the files prior to downloading.
I used AssetRipper and opened it in unity to confirm that I did indeed have the source code. I am not talented enough to complete the game but I'm sure someone on the internet
is. So the link is down below, enjoy!
