Disclaimer: I don't own this nor am I trying to claim ownership. You have the right to know what your code does! I declare the open source revolution!

All the source code is here and the rest is in Mega. I will also publish the copy of Project 06 that I ripped from in another Mega folder. Would have published here but it's larger than 2 gb.

Unfortunately Github doesn't like when I try to commit large files. The Total size of the source comes out to around 14.8 GB. 
As a result I will be uploading it to mega in a folder called src. I will upload the folder and not archive it, so feel free to browse the files prior to downloading.
I used AssetRipper and opened it in unity to confirm that I did indeed have the source code. I am not talented enough to complete the game but I'm sure someone on the internet
is. So the link is down below, enjoy!
